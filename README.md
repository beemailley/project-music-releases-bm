# Music Releases
Using React: Create components by using data from Spotify, build a page which shows new album and single releases.

## The problem
It's been a wild ride this week getting introduced to React and figuring out how to structure/create components.
Mostly learned through iteration - tried the example, tried the sandbox, then replicated the learnings into the project; lots of referring back to the materials; integrating learnings from past projects especially with how to treat API data.

We spent mon-tues going through materials and then started with the project.
Did a lot of pair programming through Slack and Live Share and then some individual branches as well.

If we had more time we would add a footer with our contact info, we tried but couldn't get it into the right placement.
